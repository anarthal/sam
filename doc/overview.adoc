# Overview

Sam is a library providing synchronization primitives for asio based application.

The primitives are modeled on common concepts, as listed below:

.List of Primitives
[options="header"]
|============================================
|Sam                   | C++ Standard
|<<mutex>>              | std::mutex
|<<condition_variable>> | std::condition_variable
|<<semaphore>>          | std::counting_semaphore
|<<barrier>>            | std::barrierfootnote:[Without a completion function]
|============================================

Any

NOTE: This library is not meant as the default method of synchronization of asio-based apps,
but to be used by library developers.
