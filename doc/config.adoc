ASem is by default considered a part of boost, thus it will use `boost/asio.hpp`.
it is however possible to use it standalone, by defining `BOOST_ASEM_STANDALONE`.
In standalone mode the namespace will be `asem` and it will include standalone `asio`.

ASem is compiled by default, but a header only mode
can be switched on by defining `BOOST_ASEM_HEADER_ONLY`.

The user needs can include `boost/asem/src.hpp` as an alternative to linking.
