Sam is by default considered a part of boost, thus it will use `boost/asio.hpp`.
it is however possible to use it standalone, by defining `BOOST_SAM_STANDALONE`.
In standalone mode the namespace will be `sam` and it will include standalone `asio`.

Sam is compiled by default, but a header only mode
can be switched on by defining `BOOST_SAM_HEADER_ONLY`.

The user needs can include `boost/sam/src.hpp` as an alternative to linking.
